# Customer Care Performance Measurement Platform - Data Model Documentation

## Overview
This PostgreSQL data model is designed to support a comprehensive performance measurement platform for customer experience across digital channels in a wireless carrier environment. The enhanced model captures customer interactions, tracks bot vs human engagement, provides comprehensive feedback management, and supports advanced analytics and AI-driven insights.

## Business Requirements Addressed

### 1. Bot vs LiveChat Measurement
The model specifically addresses the requirement to measure interactions managed by "BOT" vs "LiveChat":

- **`interaction_mode`** field in `customer_interactions` table tracks whether interaction was handled by 'bot', 'live_chat', 'self_service', 'ivr', or 'video_call'
- **`bot_duration_seconds`** and **`human_duration_seconds`** fields separately track time spent with each type of agent
- **`escalated_to_human`** boolean flag indicates when a bot interaction was escalated to human
- **`escalation_reason`** and **`escalation_timestamp`** capture detailed escalation context

### 2. Interaction Classification Logic
- If customer interacts only with bot → counts as "BOT" interaction (`interaction_mode = 'bot'`)
- If customer escalates to human → entire interaction counts as "LiveChat" (`interaction_mode = 'live_chat'`)
- Both durations are tracked separately for detailed analysis
- Queue time and transfer scenarios are also captured
