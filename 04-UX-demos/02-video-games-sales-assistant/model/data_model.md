Create a data model for B2B scenario where a wireless carrier offers to enterpises bundles of services. For instance 10K lines to Coca-Cola Company with voice, data and SMS at specific price per line defined as per the service plan

Include only the basic tables such as:
- enterprises
- bundles
- lines
- bills
- daily_usage
- devices.

Give me a sql file under directory "model" with the full details of these tables and start the script with a delete clause to delete the previous objects
